#most common
mvn clean install -DskipTests

#explanation

mvn goals executed in order:
validate >> compile >> test (optional) >> package >> verify >> install >> deploy

These are the default life cycle phases in maven

validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

clean - clean whole target folder of the project

options:
-D,--define <arg> - Define a system property
-am,--also-make - If project list is specified, also build projects required by the list
-pl,--projects <arg> - Comma-delimited list of specified reactor projects to build instead of all projects. A project can be specified by [groupId]:artifactId or by its relative path
